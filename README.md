üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Angela Drucks

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I‚Äôm currently a Computer Science student in my fifth semester at AAU Klagenfurt am W√∂rthersee, with a focus on Web Technologies, Software Engineering, and Human-Computer Interaction.

üíº Academic Background

I‚Äôve studied Java in courses like ESOP (Introduction to System and Object-Oriented Programming) and OMI (Object-Oriented Modeling and Implementation). Currently, I‚Äôm enrolled in Software Engineering 1 and have also completed Introduction to Python.

Current Courses and Projects

This semester, I am working on:

	‚Ä¢	Computer Organization (see GitHub repo)
	‚Ä¢	Web Technologies (see GitHub repo)
	‚Ä¢	Software Engineering 1 (see GitHub repo)
	‚Ä¢	Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
	‚Ä¢	Theory of Computation and Complexity Theory

üñ•Ô∏è Projects and Skills

	‚Ä¢	Web Technologies: Experienced in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.
	‚Ä¢	Software Engineering: Focused on foundational concepts, including DFAs, program dependency graphs, and software architecture.
	‚Ä¢	Assembly Programming: I enjoy applying Assembly language and have a good grasp of its logical structure, which I find rewarding to work with in 		practical applications.
	‚Ä¢	App Development: Recently gained hands-on experience with Android app development.
	‚Ä¢	Version Control: Proficient in using GitHub for managing code and collaborating on projects.

üîß Tools I Use

	‚Ä¢	Development Environments: Primarily Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.
	‚Ä¢	Operating System: macOS on a MacBook Air, M1, with experience configuring development environments and servers.
	‚Ä¢	Android Smartphone:
	‚Ä¢	Device: Android smartphone used for app testing and development, providing a native environment for mobile applications.
	‚Ä¢	Usage: Testing Android applications, debugging, and experimenting with UI/UX design on a mobile platform.
	‚Ä¢	Development Tools: Experience with tools like Android Studio for emulation and debugging directly on the device.
	‚Ä¢	Additional Software:
	‚Ä¢	MARS (MIPS Assembler): Used for simulating and developing assembly code, specifically MIPS architecture.
	‚Ä¢	yEd: A diagram editor for creating various types of graphs and diagrams, useful for flowcharts and system design.
	‚Ä¢	Visual Paradigm: A UML modeling tool used for designing and visualizing software architecture.
	‚Ä¢	Figma: A collaborative design tool, mainly used for creating UI prototypes and design systems.

üßë‚Äçüè´ Assisted Learning with LLMs

I use Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, as a supportive tool in my studies, much like a tutor or supplementary instructor. I utilize LLMs to gain deeper insights into complex concepts, verify my understanding, and explore alternative approaches to problem-solving. This approach enhances my learning experience while ensuring a focus on developing a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

üå± Areas of Interest

My current interests lie particularly in Frontend Development and Human-Computer Interaction. I‚Äôm especially fascinated by recent advancements in interactive systems, which led me to specialize in this field within my studies.
